# Tesla-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
•	Developed a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast Tesla's stock prices with 97% accuracy, leveraging historical data to capture intricate temporal patterns.
•	Data preprocessing involved cleansing and profiling a dataset of 30,000 stock price. Enhancing the model’s predictive power with rigorous evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE)
•	Technologies Used: Keras, TensorFlow, Flask, Adam optimizer, dropout layers, and Cuda to accelerated training and model optimization.

A potential use of deep learning and time series analysis is the incorporation of LSTM networks for Tesla stock price prediction. It's crucial to approach the anticipated product, meanwhile, with a realistic grasp of its possibilities and constraints.

The projected production, which usually indicates future prices of Tesla stock, can be a useful resource for traders, investors, and financial analysts. It aids in decision-making and offers insights into prospective industry trends. Nevertheless, as there are several elements that affect the stock market that are outside the purview of any one predictive model, it should be utilised in conjunction with additional study and analysis.
